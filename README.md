# AE370_Group_Project
Our projects aims to consider a re-entry vehicle travelling through Earth's atmosphere from 100km altitude, and calculate the surface temperature of the vehicle, as well as the heat flux into the surface of the vehicle. We used RK4, and compared our results to re-entry vehicle plots obtained from FAA resources

Each iteration of our code for this project is uploaded here with a different version number. The original, unedited atmosphereic code is also in this repository for reference. The final version of our code is labeled v4.
